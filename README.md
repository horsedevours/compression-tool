## A simple compression tool
- inspired by https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman

Just a personal project to back-fill some knowledge and experience I've missed out on as a self-taught developer.

`./compression-tool <compress | decompress> <inputFile> <outputFile>`

Learned plenty about
- queues and heaps
- Huffman coding
- bit manipulation
- my own patience
